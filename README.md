# **Rotating Cube with Dynamic Backgrounds**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a visually engaging React application featuring a 3D rotating cube floating in dynamic and immersive environments. By clicking a floating button, users can cycle through various atmospheric and natural backgrounds, creating an interactive and visually stimulating experience.

## **Key Features**

- **3D Rotating Cube**: A cube rendered in 3D using CSS `transform-style: preserve-3d`.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: 12 unique backgrounds including space, natural scenes, and abstract environments.
- **Floating Action Button**: A button that changes the background with a smooth transition.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices.

## **React Concepts Used**

1. **Functional Components**: The app is built using functional components (`App`, `RotatingCube`, and `FloatingButton`).
2. **State Management**: Background changes are managed using React's `useState`.
3. **Event Handling**: Button click triggers background change logic.
4. **Effect Hook**: Used in `RotatingCube` to handle the cubeâ€™s animation lifecycle.
5. **Modularity**: Components are well-separated for clarity and reusability.

## **How to Run**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-folder>
   npm install
   npm run dev
   npm run build
   ```

## **Key Benefits**

**Scalability**

- Easily extendable to include new background or interactive elements (e.g.,sound effects, UI components).

**Modularity**

- Each component (Cube, Button) is self-contained and reusable.

**Reusability**

- The FloatingButton component can be used across multiple projects without modification.

**How it works**

Prop Passing: The `App.jsx` component defines the `changeAtmosphere` function and passes it as a prop to the `RotatingCube` component.

User Interaction: When the user clicks on the cube (the main element in `RotatingCube`), the `onClick` event is triggered.

Function Call: The `onClick` event handler calls the `changeAtmosphere` function passed from `App.jsx`.

Random Atmosphere Selection:

The `changeAtmosphere` function defines a list of atmosphere names in an array called `atmospheres`.
A random atmosphere is selected using this formula:

```javascript
atmospheres[Math.floor(Math.random() * atmospheres.length)];
```

State Update: The selected atmosphere is set as the new state of background using setBackground(randomAtmosphere).

Dynamic Styling: The background state is used as a class name for the root <div> in the App component (<div className={app ${background}}>), changing the background dynamically to match the selected atmosphere.

This ensures a seamless interaction where clicking the cube triggers the background to change randomly to one of the predefined options.

#### PropTypes:

- to ensure the changAtmosphere prop is passed correctly and is of the expected type.

**Key Changes**

- 1. Importing PropTypes: Added `import PropTypes from "prop-types";`.
- 2. Defining PropTypes:
  - The changAtmosphere prop is defined as a required function using.
  - `PropTypes.func.isRequired`.

**Why Use PropTypes?**

- It helps catch bugs by validating props passed to the component.
- Ensures your code is easier to maintain and debug in the future.

**Future Ideas**

##### work in progress!

- Sound Effects: Add atmospheric sounds corresponding to each - background.
- Cube Glow: Introduce glowing effects on the cube for added aesthetics.
- Themes: Let users customize and save their favorite atmosphere combinations.
- Performance Optimization: Use React.memo or lazy loading for assets to improve performance.

**Conclusion**

- This project is a fun way to explore React concepts and CSS - animations while building an interactive 3D application. It can serve as a foundation for further development into a game, visualization tool, or educational app.

This file should work as a comprehensive `README.md` for your project. You can modify or expand it as you develop your application further!
